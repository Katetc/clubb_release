Details necessary to repeat the simulations from Storer et al. 2014:

*  SAM files necessary for prescribing radiation in TWP-ICE and ARM97, and
   for plotting comparisons with CLUBB-SILHS are available at:
   https://carson.math.uwm.edu/larson-group/storer/

*  SAM files should be placed in the SAMoutput directory within the trunk.

*  Once the SAM files are in place, simply compile and run with ./run_scm_all, which
   is set up to run only the 5 cases of interest.

*  Case files referencing the new SAM data for plotting can be found in 
   postprocessing/plotgen/cases/clubb/paper/
