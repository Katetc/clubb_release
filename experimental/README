Overview
--------

This directory has been made as a place of storage for experimental HOC files.
In other words, if you have a HOC file that contains experimental pieces of 
code that you don't want to commit to the actual HOC source code, then it 
can be stored in this directory for safe keeping.  For example, if you have 
a bit of new code that you have tested and you don't like the results, but 
you want to keep it around for future use or reference, then this is the 
directory to keep it in.  By storing it here, it will become part of the CVS
repository, so you don't have to worry about accidentally deleting it in your
home directory.  When you finally decide to either commit your new experimental
code to the actual HOC source code or entirely junk it, then please remove it 
from this directory.

Naming Convention
-----------------

Different users may have many different experimental versions of the same 
original file between them, so they can't all call it the same thing.  For 
example, two users may try to store their own experimental versions of mixing.F.
Obviously, they both can't call their files mixing.F, or one will overwrite the
other one.  Therefore, all files commited to this directory must follow a 
certain naming convention.  That convention will be the base file name 
(ex: mixing.F), followed by a period and a brief descriptive word 
(ex: clipping), followed by a period and the date that the file is being 
commited (ex: 20080104).  In the previous example, the total file name would be
mixing.F.clipping.20080104.
