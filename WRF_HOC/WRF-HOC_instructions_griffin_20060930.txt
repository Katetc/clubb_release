INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING AND RUNNING WRF-HOC
=============================================

Brian Griffin.  September 30, 2006.

Note:  The version of WRF used was Version 2.0.1.

Note:  As of 30 Sep 2006, there are 5 test cases set up in WRF-HOC.  4 of them work: BOMEX (trade-wind cumulus), FIRE (marine stratocumulus), ATEX (cumulus-rising-into stratocumulus), and Wangara (clear convective).  1 of them doesn't work: ARM (continental cumulus).


Step-by-step instructions.

1)  Download WRF-HOC and decompress.

2)  Go to WRFV2/ directory.

3)  Type ./configure

4)  Follow the instructions on the screen:
    Type in your path to your netCDF directory.
    Make sure that the version of netCDF that you are referencing was compiled
    with the same compiler that you are compiling WRF with.
    When it prompts you to enter a specific configuration option, select 
    option 1.  This is due to the fact that our version of WRF cannot be run
    in parallel due to a code change that was given to us.  It must be run in
    single-processor mode.

5)  This will produce a file called configure.wrf.  You may use the files
    configure.wrf.backup.pgi5.x as a reference.  However, your configure.wrf
    file will be different due to your paths to netcdf and everything else.
    You will need to add the path to the HOC src files and the HOC library
    files.  The following is an example:

    INCLUDE_MODULES =       -module ../main -I../external/io_netcdf -I../external/io_int -I../external/esmf_time_f90 \
                            -I../frame -I../share -I../phys -I../inc -I/home/griffinb/hoc_v2.2_tuner/src

    LIB             =       -L/home/griffinb/hoc_v2.2_tuner/lib -lhoc_param -llapack -lblas \

    Notice the reference to hoc_v2.2_tuner in both cases.

6)  Type ./compile em_quarter_ss; this will compile the code.  I have noticed
    that many times when I start from scratch, the code will not compile
    properly after I compile the first time.  However, if I immediately
    compile it again, it will compile properly the second time.

7)  Go to WRFV2/test/em_quarter_ss/.  Copy namelist.input.yyyyhoc to 
    namelist.input and copy input_sounding_yyyy to input_sounding.
    When you copied the namelist file, make sure that you copied to one
    that ended in .yyyyhoc instead of .yyyy -- otherwise you will get
    the LES version of the namelist, with no HOC interface.

8)  Type ./ideal.exe to run the pre-processor and generate initialization
    information.

9)  Type ./wrf.exe to run WRF.
