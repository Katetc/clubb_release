FOR MESSNER: Please do not delete or modify files in /home/matlabuser/plotgen
They are used to generate the nightly plots.

Usage: 'plotgen Output_Arg HOC_sim1 [HOC_sim2] Output_Directory Plot_LES Plot_Best Plot_HOCDec17'
Or:    'plotgen Output_Arg nightly Output_Directory'

The first generates plots comparing the specified simulations, e.g.
  plotgen -c /home/vlarson/HOC_dir1 /home/vlarson/HOC_dir2 /home/vlarson/HOC_output 1 0 0

The latter generates the nightly plots, e.g.
  plotgen -r nightly /home/vlarson/HOC_output

The results will be saved in 'Output_Directory' and
  can be viewed with the following command:
  'firefox Output_Directory/index.html'

'Output_Arg' must be ONE of the following:
  '-r' : Overwrite the files in the output directory
  '-c' : Create the output directory before outputting

'HOC_sim1' is the directory (including path) containing
  GrADS output files for all cases you wish to plot.
All possible cases that plotgen recognizes
  are listed at the end of generate_plots.sh.
If a case is listed but is not contained in 'HOC_sim1',
  then that case will not be plotted.

'HOC_sim2' is optional but follows the same rules
  as 'HOC_sim1'.

If the user chooses the 'nightly' option, then
  the new GrADS data to be plotted are assumed to be
  in local sub-directories named
  HOC_current/ and HOC_previous/.

Plot_LES, Plot_Best, and Plot_HOCDec17 are all boolean,
 with 1 being plot and 0 being do not plot.
The 'nightly' option assumes all 3 flags are set to 1.
