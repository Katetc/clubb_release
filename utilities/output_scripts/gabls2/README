gabls_profile.m  header_read.m  make_gabls_plots.m

These utilities are useful when dealing with the GABLS2 case.  All of 
these scripts are run in MATLAB.

Run gabls_profile.m to convert the initial specification of specific 
humidity into mixing ratio (required for HOC).

Run make_gabls_files.m to convert GABLS2 GrADS output into the required 
ASCII text output files for intercomparison submission.

Run make_gabls_plots.m to see a series of plots (and output them in .eps 
format) comparing two specified GABLS2 runs (by default, two consecutive 
runs with lKhm_aniso varying between .true. and .false.).  Because of 
the 'keyboard' command after each plot's instructions, you must type 
'return' at the prompt to move on to the next plot.
