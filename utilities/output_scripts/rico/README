These utilities are useful when dealing with the RICO case.  All of 
these scripts are run in MATLAB.

netcdf_rico_writer_x.m (where x a digit between 1 and 4 inclusive) is a 
file used to generate the required NetCDF output for RICO files.  Each 
one of the files generates one of the required files for submission to 
the RICO intercomparison.  These are good files to look at for examples 
if you want to create your own NetCDF output.

rico_profile.m is a file used to take the data supplied in the RICO 
specification (Temperature, height, specific humidity), use the 
hydrostatic approximation and the first law of thermodynamics, and 
convert to potential temperature, pressure, and mixing ratio.
