The files in this directory are used to generate the HOC code browser.

These scripts require that f90tohtml be stored in a directory called f90tohtml
in the home directory of the user running these scripts.

hoc_prepare.pl - This perl script generates a set of .ls files that contain the
list of all source files that will be displayed in the code browser, an index
if you will. This will result in the creation of hoc_ls directory in 
f90tohtml's output directory. Must be in f90tohtml's nwp_codes directory.

hoc_ls - An example of the files created by hoc_prepare.pl, use this to ensure 
hoc_prepare.pl is working correctly.

hoc.f2h - This document is used by f90tohtml to actually generate the code
browser with our desired parameters. Must be in f90tohtml's nwp_codes directory.

hoc.subject - Used by f90tohtml to generate the subject index. Must be in
f90tohtml's nwp_codes directory.

browser.bash - Invokes f90tohtml to generate the code browser. Must be in the
same home directory f90tohtml is installed in.
