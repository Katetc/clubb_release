# This script finds and displays lines of code with division. One common
# error/coding standard violation is dividing by a variable without
# including a max() statement to ensure the variable is never very small or
# zero. This script prints out all cases of division other than those that
# include a max() or just a constant number in the denominator. The user can
# then look through these results and ensure that they haven't caused any
# potential errors.
