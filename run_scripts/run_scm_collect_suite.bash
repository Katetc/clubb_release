#
# Description:
# Script that runs a predefined set of test cases for creating an overall
#   timing profile.
#
# This script will run six different cases multiple times to produce a timing
#   profile for CLUBB. Each of the cases is run with the statistics output
#   disabled, debug level set to 0, and otherwise default settings. The
#   multiple runs can then be aggregated together to provide a more robust
#   statistical sample of the cases' timings.
#
# Additional cases can be run by adding these cases to the RUN_CASE array
#   declared at the top of the script. Upon adding a case to the RUN_CASE
#   array, a value for the number of times to run that case must be added to
#   the NUM_TESTS array. Ideally, the number of times a case is run should
#   be a large enough number so that the total runtime for that case is
#   approximately equal to 7-8 minutes. This is a large enough sample time
#   to ensure reasonably accurate data, but won't take a large amount of time
#   to run the tests.
#
# WARNING: A successful run of this script will likely consume approximately
#   25-30 GB of hard drive space! Please plan accordingly to ensure that the
#   output does not fill up the hard drive on the host computer!
#
# NOTE: When running this script, it is highly recommended that the
#   computer is doing nothing else--having any other programs running,
#   even an instance of GVim, will likely increase the inconsistency
#   of the results. Ideally, try to ensure that the only program running
#   on that computer besides the script is your SSH session/terminal window
#   that started the script, at the most. This includes programs that are run
#   by other users.
