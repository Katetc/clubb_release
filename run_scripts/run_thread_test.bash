# Desciption:
#   Script to run the test whether CLUBB is still threadsafe.
#   We need this because not all versions of Fortran accept command line
#   arguments (a Fortran 2003 feature), and GNU Fortran has trouble with
#   comments in namelists
# Notes:
#   This has been tested with GNU Bash v4.1.2 on GNU/Linux.  The sed command
#   used only works with GNU sed.
