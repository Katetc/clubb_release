# Script that times a run of the standalone CLUBB program for all models.
# Utilizes the -e (--performance_test) option of run_scm(_all).bash, and
#   the time system command.
#
# Accepts one optional argument, which pipes the output of the time
#   command to a file rather than output to standard out. This is because
#   the time command's output behaves oddly, and needs to be piped in a
#   special manner.
