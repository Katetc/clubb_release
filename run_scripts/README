This directory contains scripts for the various programs that can be used with
the CLUBB parameterization.

generate_seed.bash: 
  Generates a psuedo random seed that is used by the tuner.

run_bin_diff_all.bash: 
  Compares the output for all cases specified in run_scm_all.bash in 
  two specified directories.

run_inputfields.bash: 
  Runs CLUBB with specified prognostic variables from a GrADS or netCDF 
  stats file.

run_jacobian.bash: 
  Runs the CLUBB jacobian program.

run_scm_all.bash: 
  Runs all of the cases CLUBB is set up to do.

  NOTE: Optionally, you can specify a manual grid for the runs. This is done
  with the command line options --zt_grid (or -z) and --zm_grid (or -m).
  These options are used by first specifying the desired grid file, then the
  number of grid levels after the command line option -l (or --levels).
  For example, to use a 30-level coarse grid specified on the zt points:
  ./run_scm_all.bash --zt_grid ../input/grid/coarse_30lev_32km_zt_grid.grd --levels 30
    OR
  ./run_scm_all.bash -z ../input/grid/coarse_30lev_32km_zt_grid.grd -l 30

  To specify a custom stats file, use the --stats option. For example, to use
  the nightly stats, ./run_scm_all.bash --stats ../input/stats/nightly_stats.in

RUN_CASES:
  The file RUN_CASES lists all the cases to be run with run_bindiff_all.bash 
and run_scm_all.bash. This makes it easier for external users to run CLUBB 
since they can comment out cases.  It also makes it easier for UWM to add a 
new case.

run_scm.bash: 
  Runs CLUBB for a specified case. The case is specified with the model name.

  NOTE: Optionally, you can specify a manual grid for a model run. This is done
  with the command line options --zt_grid (or -z) and --zm_grid (or -m).
  These options are used by first specifying the desired grid file, then the 
  number of grid levels after the command line option -l (or --levels).
  For example, to use a 30-level coarse grid specified on the zt points 
  to run the arm case:
  ./run_scm.bash --zt_grid ../input/grid/coarse_30lev_32km_zt_grid.grd --levels 30 arm
    OR
  ./run_scm.bash -z ../input/grid/coarse_30lev_32km_zt_grid.grd -l 30 arm

rum_scm_collect.bash: 
  Runs a case in CLUBB while using the Sun Studio profiler to collect runtime 
  statistics.  For best results, the CLUBB code should be compiled with the Sun
  Studio compiler to use this script.  However, the Intel compiler has been
  confirmed to work as well.  The name of the output directory and optionally
  case name are arguments for the script.

  NOTE: It is highly recommended that no other programs are running on the
  computer that runs this script. If other programs are running, the results
  may be inconsistent and possibly misleading.

run_scm_collect_suite.bash
  Runs a selected set of cases in CLUBB while using the Sun Studio profiler to
  collect runtime statistics for all of them. For best results, the CLUBB code
  should be compiled with the Sun Studio compiler to use this script. However,
  the Intel compiler has been confirmed to work as well. Each case will be run
  a few times to allow for averaging of the runtime statistics. The name of the
  output directory and optionally the number of times to run each of the cases
  are arguments for the script.

  NOTE: It is highly recommended that no other programs are running on the
  computer that runs this script. If other programs are running, the results
  may be inconsistent and possibly misleading.

run_timestep_tests.bash: 
  Runs all of the cases CLUBB is set up to do. CLUBB is ran several times for 
  each case at different timestep settings.

run_tuner.bash: 
  Runs the CLUBB tuning program.
