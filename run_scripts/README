This directory contains scripts for the various programs that can be used with
the CLUBB parameterization.

generate_seed.bash: 
  Generates a psuedo random seed that is used by the tuner.

run_bin_diff_all.bash: 
  Compares the output for all cases specified in run_scm_all.bash in 
  two specified directories.

run_inputfields.bash: 
  Runs CLUBB with specified prognostic variables from a GrADS or netCDF 
  stats file.

run_jacobian.bash: 
  Runs the CLUBB jacobian program.

run_scm_all.bash: 
  Runs all of the cases CLUBB is set up to do.

  NOTE: Optionally, you can specify a manual grid for the runs. This is done
  with the command line options --zm_grid_test and --zt_grid_test.
  These options are used by first specifying the number of grid levels, then
  the desired grid file.
  For example, to use a 30-level coarse grid specified on the zt points:
  ./run_scm_all.bash --zt_grid_test 30 ../input/grid/coarse_30lev_32km_zt_grid.grd

  To specify a custom stats file, use the --stats option. For example, to use
  the nightly stats, ./run_scm_all.bash --stats ../input/stats/nightly_stats.in

run_scm.bash: 
  Runs CLUBB for a specified case. The case is specified with the model name.

  NOTE: Optionally, you can specify a manual grid for a model run. This is done
  with the command line options --zm_grid_test and --zt_grid_test.
  These options are used by first specifying the number of grid levels, then
  the desired grid file. For example, to use a 30-level coarse grid specified on
  the zt points to run the arm case:
  ./run_scm.bash --zt_grid_test 30 ../input/grid/coarse_30lev_32km_zt_grid.grd arm

rum_scm_collect.bash: 
  Runs a case in CLUBB while using the Sun Studio profiler to collect runtime 
  statistics.  The CLUBB code must be compiled with the Sun Studio compiler to
  use this script.  The name of the output directory and optionally case name
  are arguments for the script.

run_timestep_tests.bash: 
  Runs all of the cases CLUBB is set up to do. CLUBB is ran several times for 
  each case at different timestep settings.

run_tuner.bash: 
  Runs the CLUBB tuning program.
