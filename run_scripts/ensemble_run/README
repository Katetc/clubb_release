This directory contains scripts that aid in the setting
up and running of ensembles using CLUBB. They should
work mostly out of the box for TWP_ICE, but will require
modifications for different ensemble cases.

DIRECTORIES:
  input: This folder contains subfolders which in turn
         hold raw forcing data for an individual ensemble
         member. This data is assumed to not be in a CLUBB
         compatible format (eg. ARM). Subfolders should
         be named ensmem## where ## is the number of the
         ensemble member. The scripts will not work if
         there are more than 100 ensemble members (00 - 99)
         but skipping ensemble members is accepable.

  ensembles: This folder contains subfolders which in turn
             hold forcing data which has been converted for
             use by CLUBB. It is assumed that it will be
             populated by ensemble_setup.bash. The
             subfolders are named ensemble## where ## is
             the number of the ensemble member whose setup
             files are contained within.

  output: This folder contains subfolders which contain the
          CLUBB output for the various ensemble runs. It is
          assumed that it will be populated by
          ensemble_run.bash. Folder naming follows the same
          pattern as the ensembles folder.

SCRIPTS:
  ensemble_setup.bash: Runs a series of MATLAB scripts to
                       convert the data contained in the
                       input directory in to CLUBB
                       compatible forcing files. It
                       requires the MATLAB scripts from
                       clubb/utilities/case_setup/twp_ice
                       to be moved to this directory. It
                       also requires convert_units.m from
                       clubb/postprocessing/matlab_include

  ensemble_run.bash: Runs all of the ensembles with forcing
                     data contained in the ensembles
                     directory. Results from these runs
                     will be moved to the output directory.

  create_output.bash: Uses supplementary MATLAB scripts to
                      convert CLUBB output in to whatever
                      file type is necessary for
                      submission. In the case of TWP_ICE
                      this is NetCDF. It uses both
                      twp_ice_profiles_creator.m and
                      twp_ice_timeseries_creator.m. It
                      also requires header_read.m,
                      convert_units.m, and
                      read_grads_clubb_endian.m from
                      clubb/postprocessing/matlab_include
