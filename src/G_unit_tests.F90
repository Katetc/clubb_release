  !                               USIN' CLUBB
  !                               ===========
  !         (Parody to be rapped to the beat of "In Da Club" by 50 Cent)
  !
  ! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go CLUBB!
  ! Commit 7000!
  ! We gonna party like its a birthday!
  ! We gonna sip Bicardi like its a birthday!
  ! And we don't care cause it's commit 7000!
  !
  ! (Chorus 2x)
  ! You will find me usin' CLUBB, chewin' on a sub,
  ! Mumma, I got what ya need if you need beneath the grid.
  ! I'm into PDFs, I ain't into mass flux junk,
  ! So come checkout CLUBB, if ya like the stuff we did.
  !
  ! (Verse)
  ! My code's as pretty as a Benz on Dubs,
  ! But the Sun Compiler's squaking -- always drama usin' CLUBB.
  ! When we match the LES everybody shows us love,
  ! And when we don't have low clouds nobody shows us love.
  ! But homie ain't nothing change, ...
  !
  ! Need more verses ... place yours here!
  ! 
  !
  ! (Chorus 2x)
  !
  ! (Bridge)
  ! The micro handles rain, ice, and snow,
  ! plus we got all our fancy schemes,
  ! An-al-y-tic micro and SILHS,
  ! We're best on the subgrid and that won't change.
  !
  ! (Verse)
  ! And you're gonna love it, way more than you hate it,
  ! Oh, you mad?  I thought you'd be happy we made it.
  ! We're the best darn param. for subgrid clouds,
  ! And when you use us for micro ya know you'll be wowwed.
  !
  ! Need more verses ... place yours here!
  !
  !
  ! (Chorus 2x)
  !
  ! Don't try to act like you don't know what we be usin' either,
  ! We be usin' CLUBB all the time, it's about the blast off!

  ! I can ride my CLUBB going standalone.
  !                     going standalone.
  !                     going standalone.
  ! I can ride my CLUBB with no host model.
  !                     with no host model.
  !                     with no host model.
  !
  ! Hey, hey, look at me. Advancing prognostic moments like I'm supposed to be.
  ! On top... and the bottom of the domain; staggered grid for conveniency.
  ! I can write code to conserve water; my residual has no negativity.
  ! I discretize implicitly to prevent numerical instability!
  !
  ! I can advance a point-based microphysics scheme; no I don't ignore subgrid variability!
  ! I can upscale it by numerical integration, or derive the integral analytically.
  ! Just give me some sounding terms... once I find the right PDF family,
  ! I can close those higher order moments, so making assumptions there's no need cause
  !
  ! I can resolve a grid box with a PDF!
  !                          with a PDF!
  !                          with a PDF!
  !                          with a PDF!
  !                          with a PDFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  !  (Tune switches to "Singing in the Rain" by Ignacio Herbert Brown)
  !
  !  I'm singing in the rain,
  !  just singing (and parameterizing subgrid variability) in the rain
  !  What a glorious feeling (when the Bitten tests run and then)
  !  I'm happy again.
  !  I'm laughing at clouds
  !  so dark up above.
  !  The sun's in my heart
  !  And I'm ready for love (or at least another simulation of RICO).
  !  Let the stormy clouds (from ARM97) chase
  !  everyone (especially parameterizations lacking a rigorous theoretical basis) from the place.
  !  (They have too much convective inhibition
  !  to produce satisfactory results in the GCSS intercomparison.)
  !  I walk down the lane
  !  with a happy refrain,
  !  just singing,
  !  singing (and also parameterizing) in the rain.
  !
  !  Dancing in the rain (because my co-workers were tired of my singing and kicked me out of W404)
  !  Dee-ah dee-ah dee-ah
  !  Dee-ah dee-ah dee-ah
  !  I'm happy again (as long as the 2 lines above weren't a new and unfamiliar compiler warning)!
  !  I'm singing and dancing in the rain (are any of the doors to EMS unlocked on a weekend?).
