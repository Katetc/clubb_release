    Added non-trapezoidal zm interpolation for cloud_frac (#1127)
    
    - Added a calculation for `cloud_frac_zm` when `l_call_pdf_closure_twice=false` and `l_trapezoidal_rule_zt=false`
    This is BIT_CHANGING if `l_call_pdf_closure_twice=false` and `l_trapezoidal_rule_zt=false` since, in that case, `cloud_frac_zm` is now nonzero.
    - Some minor formatting fixes
    - Some minor fixes to pyplotgen's source code
    - Added `a3_coef_min` to Lscale tunable_parameters.in

    BIT_CHANGING! Updated taus code calculations - CLUBB ticket #1115 (#1125)
    
    - Changed invrs_tau_xp2/wp2 calculations to match the wpxp calculation:
       Those now have a brunt_freq_pos and a brunt_freq_out_cloud term
    - Changed tmp_calc magic number from .007 to .001
    - Changed upper clipping bound for Ri_zm from 12 to 2 in invrs_tau_wpxp calculation
    - Reversed accidental changes to input_misc/tuner/error_four_cases.in

    Setting the minimum tolerance to be epsilon, this is BIT_CHANGING but only for single precision. See larson-group/clubb#1126

    Changing order of sqrt and **3 to improve stability, see clubb#1126. Since this is a change to the order of operations, it is BIT_CHANGING.

    New Stats Indices Type (#1118)
    
    * Grouping stats indices into a derived type and making that accessible globally, for now. This does not run yet, but a checkpoint I wish to save.
    
    * Checkpoint to save
    
    * Checkpoint
    
    * It actually works now and is BFB with every case.
    
    * Starting to push the new derived type through the argument list.
    
    * The new dervied type, now stats_metadata, has been fed through the argument list.
    
    * Moved l_stats_samp into stats_metadata
    
    * Moved all the other stats_variables into stats_metadata
    
    * Small cleanup
    
    * Fixes a stats bug when calling compute_sample_mean in silhs.
    
    * Arrays in stats_metadata need only be allocated once, but we may want to call the stats init routines to set up more stats variables. So now we check for allocation before allocating. Also made the stat_indices type publicly available through clubb_api.
    
    * This should be initialized to 0. The new changes in cam were able to tease this out, which is a good sign.
    
    * A couple more to initialize to zero.
    
    * Moving stats_metadata to before stats_ variables in argument lists, just for consistency.
    
    * Changing stat_indices to stats_metadata_type

    Quick fix for AnimationPanel so it works with the background-rcm changes (#1123)
    
    - Modified super call in AnimationPanel constructor
    - Removed first frame from consideration when determining x-axis scaling since the starting values are sometimes large compared to the other time steps
