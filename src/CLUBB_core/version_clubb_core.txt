    BIT_CHANGING! Updated taus code calculations - CLUBB ticket #1115 (#1125)
    
    - Changed invrs_tau_xp2/wp2 calculations to match the wpxp calculation:
       Those now have a brunt_freq_pos and a brunt_freq_out_cloud term
    - Changed tmp_calc magic number from .007 to .001
    - Changed upper clipping bound for Ri_zm from 12 to 2 in invrs_tau_wpxp calculation
    - Reversed accidental changes to input_misc/tuner/error_four_cases.in

    Setting the minimum tolerance to be epsilon, this is BIT_CHANGING but only for single precision. See larson-group/clubb#1126

    Changing order of sqrt and **3 to improve stability, see clubb#1126. Since this is a change to the order of operations, it is BIT_CHANGING.

    stats_metadata needs to be threadprivate to make our standalone thread test work.

    New Stats Indices Type (#1118)
    
    * Grouping stats indices into a derived type and making that accessible globally, for now. This does not run yet, but a checkpoint I wish to save.
    
    * Checkpoint to save
    
    * Checkpoint
    
    * It actually works now and is BFB with every case.
    
    * Starting to push the new derived type through the argument list.
    
    * The new dervied type, now stats_metadata, has been fed through the argument list.
    
    * Moved l_stats_samp into stats_metadata
    
    * Moved all the other stats_variables into stats_metadata
    
    * Small cleanup
    
    * Fixes a stats bug when calling compute_sample_mean in silhs.
    
    * Arrays in stats_metadata need only be allocated once, but we may want to call the stats init routines to set up more stats variables. So now we check for allocation before allocating. Also made the stat_indices type publicly available through clubb_api.
    
    * This should be initialized to 0. The new changes in cam were able to tease this out, which is a good sign.
    
    * A couple more to initialize to zero.
    
    * Moving stats_metadata to before stats_ variables in argument lists, just for consistency.
    
    * Changing stat_indices to stats_metadata_type

    Quick fix for AnimationPanel so it works with the background-rcm changes (#1123)
    
    - Modified super call in AnimationPanel constructor
    - Removed first frame from consideration when determining x-axis scaling since the starting values are sometimes large compared to the other time steps

    Z displace tunable (#1122)
    
    CLUBB ticket #1115
    Added the previously hard-coded z_displace as a tunable parameter.

    Removing begin_height and end_height as outputs from setup_grid. They
    are only necessary as local variables inside of setup_grid.

    Updated CLUBB so that adj_low_res_nu (which can be called on its own
    or called through calling setup_parameters) no longer uses
    momentum_heights and thermodynamic_heights, but rather makes use
    of gr%zm and gr%zt, which are always set and available by the
    time the calls are made.

    BIT_CHANGING! Fixed some issues with wpxp_Ri_exp, changed z_displace value - CLUBB ticket #1115 (#1120)
    
    - Removed commented lines from tunable_parameters.in file in input/tunable_parameters_tauMatchLscale
    - Increased z_displace value from 10 to 25. This value was chosen so that the taus code with the parameter and flag settings in input/tunable_parameters_tauMatchLscale match the master Lscale output below clouds
    - Fixed some issues with the new parameter wpxp_Ri_exp:
       - Moved new exponentiation to a place so that it emulates the previous version with sqrt(Ri_zm)
       - Adjusted code for l_smooth_min_max=true to match the default version
