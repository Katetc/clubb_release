# Configuration File for Compaq f95 on the UWM alpha
# == Compiler invocation ==
FC=f95 # DEC/Compaq Fortran

# == Debugging ==
# It is sometimes helpful to turn on floating-point trapping for the 
#  standalone program, but this will not work when using the tuner.
# The usual options:
DEBUG=-g -check bounds -no_fp_reorder # Compaq f95

# == Optimization ==
# Sun's f95 has great difficulty with statistics.F
# For SS11, either turn off optimization for that file or expect a long 
#  compilation.  SS10 appears to fail altogether.
# These are all pretty conservative options, check the your compiler manual 
# for information on using more aggressive techniques (inlining, etc.)
OPTIMIZE=-O2 -arch host # Compaq f95 on Alpha

# == NetCDF Flags ==
NC_LOC=/usr/local/netcdf

# == Linking Flags ==
# Use -s to strip (no debugging); 
 LDFLAGS=-L$(NC_LOC)/lib -lnetcdf 

# == Compiler flags (all) ==
# Preprocessing:
#   -DSTATS enables statistics
#   -DSCALARS enables passive scalars
#   -DBIG_ENDIAN_IO use only if compiler performs big endian file i/O
#                   regardless of internal representation
#   -DLITTLE_ENDIAN_IO use only if compiler performs little endian file i/O
#                   regardless of internal representation
#   -Dradoffline and -Dnooverlap (see bugsrad documentation)
# You will need to `make clean' if you change these

 FCFLAGS=$(OPTIMIZE) $(DEBUG) -DSTATS -Dnooverlap -Dradoffline -I$(NC_LOC)/include
