This folder holes "fake" modules for interfacing with the
Morrison-Gettelman microphysics. cldwat2m_micro contains
multiple import (use) statements, and to avoid possibly
breaking the CAM code, we've decided to, rather than edit
cldwat2m_micro, create these fake modules that will supply
cldwat2m_micro with the actual values it is looking for
from CLUBB. In some cases, the variables and subroutines
are not even being used, so we create a dummy variable
in its place. These should not be used/called, but are
needed for MG to compile.
