# == Paths ==
# This is where the make command is going to put the resulting files

# == Compiler invocation ==
FC = g95 # g95 ( http://www.g95.org )

# == Debugging ==
# It is sometimes helpful to turn on floating-point trapping for the 
#  standalone program, but this will not work when using the tuner.
# In g95: `setenv G95_FPU_INVALID TRUE' or `export G95_FPU_INVALID=TRUE'
# These are the options for debugging symbols, bounds checking, IEEE-754,
# and a special g95 flag for debugging, respectively. 
DEBUG = -g -fbounds-check -mieee-fp -ftrace=full

# == Warnings ==
# This is the set of preferred warnings to use when compiling CLUBB with g95.
# Warnings ignored are:
# 	142 - Nonblock DO statement is obsolescent 
# 	165 - Implicit interface is called
# 	167 - PRIVATE module procedure is never invoked
WARNINGS = -Wall -Wextra -Wno=142,165,167 -pedantic

# == Machine specific flags ==
# Note: some of these are 64 bit architectures, so make sure NetCDF is
# compiled accordingly.
#ARCH = -march=nocona -msse3 -mfpmath=sse     # New P4s
#ARCH = -march=nocona -msse3 -mfpmath=sse -r8 # New P4s, double precision
ARCH = -march=k8 -msse3 -mfpmath=sse         # New Opterons

# == Optimization ==
# These are all pretty conservative options. Check your compiler manual
# for information on using more aggressive techniques (inlining, etc.)
OPTIMIZE = -O2

# == NetCDF Location ==
#NC_LOC = $(HOME)/netcdf-3.6.1
NC_LOC = /usr/local/netcdf-g95

# === LAPACK libraries ==
LAPACK = -L/usr/local/lib -llapack -lblas

# == Linking Flags ==
# Use -s to strip (no debugging); 
# Use -L<library path> -l<lib> to link in an external library
# Use -Wl,-rpath <library path> to set a search path for shared libs

# == Compiler flags (all) ==
# Preprocessing Directives:
#   -DNETCDF enables netCDF output
#   -DCOAMPS_MICRO enables COAMPS microphysics scheme
#   -DTUNER enables the tuning application
#   -Dradoffline and -Dnooverlap (see bugsrad documentation)
# You will need to `make clean' if you change these
# Use -I<include path> to set a module or header file directory
