The results of the hydrometeor PDF shapes paper can be generated by:

1)  Running run_scripts/run_DDL_DL_SL_background in the background.  For
    example, go to the run_scripts directory and use the command:

    at now -f run_DDL_DL_SL_background

2)  Otherwise, by running run_scripts/run_DDL_DL_SL_cases.bash.  For example, go
    to the run_scripts directory and use the command:

    ./run_DDL_DL_SL_cases.bash -p -f -m

    where -p, -f, -m are options for producing the PDF plots (-p), running the
    goodness-of-fit tests (-f), and/or producing the profiles of microphysics
    process rates (-m).

3)  All the output besides the PDF plots can be found in a subdirectory in the
    output directory.  This subdirectory is named by the date and time of the
    start of the run.  The PDF plots are found in subdirectories in the
    postprocessing/matlab_scatter_contour_plots/output directory.  Each
    subdirectory contains a grouping of PDF plots and is named by the date and
    time of the start of the run for each grouping.
