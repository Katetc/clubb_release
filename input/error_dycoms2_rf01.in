! Parameter file for subroutine tuner_init in there error module. 
! All parameters are used by amoeba or amebsa to "tune" hoc.

! ftol is the degree of accuracy in "tuning" (i.e. the # of digits)
! l_results_stdout print all results of tuning to the terminal if true
! l_results_file will generate a new error.in based on the new constants if true
! anneal_temp and anneal_iter are only used in amebsa runs;  they determine
!  the starting temperature for the algoritm, and number of times the
!  subroutine is called, respectively.
! tune_type is either 0 for amoeba(downhill simplex method with random restart)
!   or any other integer for amebsa(downhill simplex with simulated annealing)

! Setting t_variables:
! Most variables are named in the same fashion in both HOC and LES, but
!   because some are not they must be specified as an ordered pair of strings.

! Known values of hoc_v and les_v for some variables are listed in the 
! following table:
!  Variables
!  HOC	 | LES
!  ------------
!  cf	 | cf
!  rcm   | qcm
!  wp3	 | wp3
!  thlm	 | thlm
!  rtm   | qtm
!  um    | um  
!  vm    | vm
!  wp2zt | wp2
!
!  Values of hoc_v and les_v for other variables can be found in the .ctl files.
!
!  Key variables for UWM: qcm/rcm, cf, rtm/qtm, thlm, um, vm, wp3

! hoc_stats_file is the name of hoc zt data file;  This should be the same as 
!   fname_zt in the statsnl namelist.
! les_stats_file is the name of LES grads data file
! z_i and z_f are levels to look at when tuning. This does not need
!   to be 1 to nz if you wish to optimize for particular altitudes.
!   Note that the first and last z-levels in hoc are not prognosed.
! time_nl is the time interval(s) to tune for, in ordered pair form.
