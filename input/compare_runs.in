!  file1 should be the new HOC simulation that you want to check.
!  If you want to compare with LES output, file2 must be the LES file.
!  file3 should be a reference HOC output from a trusted (old) simulation.

!  t(1), t(2) are the 1st and last timestep (minute) of the 1st time interval.
!  t(3), t(4) are the 1st and last timestep (minute) of the 2nd time interval.
