! This file contains a cloud correlation matrix. This can be looked at as a
! two-dimensional array with an equal number of rows and columns. For each
! column, the row at the same index is the same variable. For example, this
! matrix should look like the following:
!
!    | s | t | w | Nc |...|
!  s | 1 | x | x | x  | x |
!  t | * | 1 | x | x  | x |
!  w | * | * | 1 | x  | x |
!  Nc| * | * | * | 1  | x |
! ...| * | * | * | *  | 1 |
!
! Where x represents a value and * is an ignored cell. The bottom half of 
! the matrix can be ignored becasue the matrix is symmetrical. The main
! diagonal is always filled with a value of 1.0.
!
! All unkown values are left at 0.0. All values in the bottom of
! the matrix are 0.0, but they can be set to any number because they are
! ignored.
