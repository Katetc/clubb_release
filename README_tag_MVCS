The results of the paper on the microphysical effects on variances and covariances of
total water mixing ratio and liquid water potential temperature can be generated by:

1) Compiling CLUBB.  Go to the compile directory and use the command:

   ./compile.bash

   This command may differ slightly depending on the infrastructure and compiler.
   For example,

   ./compile.bash config/linux_x86_64_pgroup.bash

   compiles for Linux x86 (64 bit) using the PGI compiler.

2) Running RICO.

   Go to the run_scripts directory and use the command:

   ./run_scm.bash rico

   The results will be automatically placed into the output directory.  Once the case
   has finished running, it is best to create a new subdirectory of the output
   directory and move the results into it.

3) Running DYCOMS-II RF02.

   Go back to the run_scripts directory and use the command:

   ./run_scm.bash dycoms2_rf02_do

   Again, the results will be automatically placed into the output directory.

4) Running RICO with the effects of microphysics on variances and covariances
   turned off.

   First, edit the file input/case_setups/rico_model.in and make the following change:

   l_var_covar_src = .false.

   As a side note, the tag MVCS is short for microphysics var/covar source.

   While editing, it is also best to change the names of the output files.  Otherwise,
   they will be rico_* by default and the RICO output from step (2) above might be
   overwritten if it wasn't moved to its own subdirectory.  The output files' names
   can be changed by editing the following line:

   fname_prefix = "rico"   ! Prefix of output filename.

   The fname_prefix could be changed to "rico_mvcs_off" or something similar.

   The code does not need to be recompiled.  Then, return to the run_scripts directory
   and use the command:

   ./run_scm.bash rico

   Again, the results will be automatically placed into the output directory.
