MODEL/GRID DIRECTORY OVERVIEW
=============================

This directory contains files that can be read in as grid altitude inputs on
either momentum levels (*zm_grid.grd files) or thermodynamic levels 
(*zt_grid.grd files), depending if either grid_type = 3 or grid_type = 2,
respectively, was selected in the appropriate model.in file.

Note:  To use an evenly-spaced grid, simply select grid_type = 1 in the 
       appropriate model.in file.  Also enter the grid spacing (deltaz) and
       the lowest altitude level (zm_init) (found at momentum level 1) in the 
       appropriate model.in file.

The number of entries in the *zm_grid.grd or *zt_grid.grd file needs to match
the number of vertical levels (nzmax) declared in the appropriate model.in 
file.

All *zm_grid.grd or *zt_grid.grd files need to be in written in the format of 
one altitude entry per line in ascending order, with the lowest grid altitude
listed as the first entry in the file.

The following is a list of cases and files that have stretched grids (please
update this list as stretched grids are changed or added):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DYCOMS-II RF02 
(dycoms2_rf02_do, dycoms2_rf02_ds, dycoms2_rf02_nd, and dycoms2_rf02_so):

dycoms2_rf02_gcss_zm_grid.grd file:

The DYCOMS-II RF02 GCSS zm_grid.grd file is taken from the results of running 
the grid-generating source code found on the DYCOMS-II RF02 website.  The 
DYCOMS-II RF02 intercomparison specifies a stretched grid that is based on 97 
momentum levels covering a 1500 m. vertical domain.  The thermodynamic levels 
are placed halfway between the momentum levels.


dycoms2_rf02_sam_zt_grid.grd file:

The DYCOMS-II RF02 SAM zt_grid.grd file is based on the stretched grid that is 
found in SAM for that case.  The stretched grid found in SAM is generated from 
the same source code found at the DYCOMS-II RF02 website as mentioned above, but
altered so that it takes 148 momentum levels to cover the 1500 m. vertical 
domain.  Again, the source code places the thermodynamic levels halfway between 
the momentum levels.  However, for purposes of SAM, the thermodynamic levels are
output from the source code.  SAM reads the thermodynamic levels as input, and 
then places it's momentum levels halfway between the thermodynamic levels.  
Thus, the resulting momentum levels in SAM are at slightly different altitudes 
than the momentum levels output by the original source code.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deep Convective Cases:
LBA (lba), ARM 97 (arm_97), ARM 0003 (arm_0003), and ARM 3-year (arm_3year):

deep_convection_128lev_27km_zt_grid.grd file:

The deep convection (128 level; 27+ km) zt_grid.grd file is based on the 
stretched grid that is found in SAM for the LBA case.  The same stretched grid 
is found in SAM for the GATE_noshear_normalf case.  There are 128 grid levels 
that cover the 27500 m. vertical domain.  The lowest grid levels are at -25 m. 
and 25 m.  Grid levels are 25 m. to 65 m. apart near the surface and gradually 
increase in thickness until they reach 250 m. apart at an altitude of 5750 m.  
Above that level, the grid levels remain 250 m. apart.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ECMWF grid 

ecmwf_90lev_zt_grid.grd file:

This is the L90 grid used for the ECMWF forecast model.  The levels are 
an approximate height in meters and based on the pressure levels given here:

http://www.ecmwf.int/products/data/technical/model_levels/model_def_91.html

The grid has a coarser resolution than the deep convective grid and is so
closer the grid tht might be used in an operational forecast model.
