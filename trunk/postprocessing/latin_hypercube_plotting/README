These MATLAB scripts were used for plotting the individual subcolumns of 
three sets of latin hypercube simulations.  They were:

1. A maximal overlap assumption where we set vert_corr_coef to 0.
2. An intermediate overlap assumption we left vert_corr_coef as 0.1
3. A random overlap assumption where we set vert_corr_coef to 1000.

The plot_spaghetti.m function could be adapted to plot any resulting lognormal
or uniformlly distributed variables from the latin hypercube netCDF files with 
minimal modification.
