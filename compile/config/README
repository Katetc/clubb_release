This directory contains platform specific configuration files for the mkmf 
script.  This allows users to have a setup for their specific computer
and compiler configuration.

Adding a new case should be fairly straightforward.  The easiest method is to 
copy an existing file to a new .bash file and modify it for your platform.  We
have adopted a loose convention for naming files based on the operating system,
architecture, and compiler used. That is:

<OS name>_<CPU type>_<Compiler>_<Optional identifiers>.bash

Generally these can be identified on a UNIX-compatible system by using:

$ uname -s for the OS name

$ uname -m for the CPU type

Followed by the compiler vendor or the command used to compile.

In some cases we've chosen to use the more common name for the OS rather than
the results of uname -s to make things more clear for users.  Hence we used 
"solaris" rather than "SunOS", and "macosx" rather than "Darwin" to indentify
the operating systems of Oracle and Apple.  When adding new config the name
used is at the discretion of the person porting CLUBB to the new platform, 
but it should chosen to avoid confusion with new users if possible.
