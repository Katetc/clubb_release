# It is sometimes helpful to turn on floating-point trapping for the

# These are the options for debugging symbols, bounds checking & IEEE-754

# == Warnings ==
WARNINGS="-Wall -pedantic" # This enabled most compiler warnings

# == Machine specific flags ==
# Note: If the native architecture is 64 bit (most newer Mac's) then the 
# netCDF and LAPACK libraries used must be 64 bit too
ARCH="-march=native"
#ARCH="-m64"

# == Used to promote all real's to double precision ==
DOUBLE_PRECISION="-fdefault-real-8"

# == Optimization ==
OPTIMIZE="-O2"

# == NetCDF Location ==
# There's currently no netCDF for the Macs in W343.
# Point this to the location of your copy of netCDF if you're using a 
# different computer and use the lines below that have "netCDF v4" after them.
#NETCDF="/Users/dschanen/netcdf-gfortran" # netCDF v4

# == LAPACK libraries ==
LAPACK="-llapack -lblas" # The netlib reference LAPACK/BLAS
#LAPACK="-L/usr/lib64 -llapack -L/usr/local/atlas/lib -lf77blas -lcblas -latlas" # ATLAS BLAS (faster)

# == Linking Flags ==
# Use -s to strip (no debugging); 
# Use -L<library path> -l<lib> to link in an external library
# Use -Wl,-rpath <library path> to set a search path for shared libs
#LDFLAGS="$ARCH $LAPACK -L$NETCDF/lib -Wl,-rpath $NETCDF/lib -lnetcdf -lnetcdff" # netCDF v4
LDFLAGS="$ARCH $LAPACK" # No netCDF

# == Compiler flags ==
# You will need to `make clean' if you change these.
#FFLAGS="$ARCH $OPTIMIZE $DEBUG"
