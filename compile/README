This directory contains scripts to compile CLUBB. 

If you want to compile with the default compiler (g95):
  ./compile.bash

To compile with a different compiler, pass the .bash script for the compiler
you want to use (found in ./config/) into the compile script:
  ./compile.bash [COMPILER_CONFIG]

If you want to run the compiler tests, which compiles CLUBB using the g95, 
SunStudio, and Intel Fortran compilers:
  ./compiler_tests.bash
