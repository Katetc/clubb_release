! Description:
! Namelists for the hoc_standalone program. 
! run_file is the location of the model namelist file, which contains the 
! statistics and sounding data. 
! stdout will determine if the model prints out its status over iterations 
! C4, C14, and nu9 are only relevant when lKhm_aniso is enabled.
! C2, C2b, & C2c are not used unless diag_var is compiled with -DSINGLE_C2_SKW
