# PyPlotgen Autogenerated Reference Documentation
This folder contains reference documentation created from the doc strings in the python source code.  

## Viewing the docs
The latest version of docs are available at `_build/html/index.html` 

## Updating the docs
Updating the docs should be as easy running `updateDocs.sh`.  
These docs are built on Sphinx. If the update script fails, make sure pip3 (a python package manager) 
is installed on the machine. If that does not fix the issue, new troubleshooting steps will be needed.

### Adding a new class
If a new class/`.py` file has been added, it will need to have it's module defined in a `.rst` file.  
Doing so is simple. For example, to add the `src/VariableGroup.py` file, we add the following text 
to `pyplotgen.src.rst`, and then rerun the `updateDocs.sh`, and that's it!
```
pyplotgen.src.VariableGroup module

.. automodule:: src.VariableGroup
