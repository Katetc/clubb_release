Plotgen 3.0 Case Implementation Readme:
=======================================

This is the folder where cases are described. Each case should have its
own case file. For your convenience, there are two template case files to
hopefully make it easier for you to implement a new case.

Follow these steps when implementing a new case:

1. To implement a new case without LES, Best Ever, and 12/17 data, copy 
template_simple.case to <YOUR CASE NAME>.case. If you are implementing a 
case with LES, Best Ever and 12/17 data, copy template_all.case to 
<YOUR CASE NAME>.case.

2. Open your newly created case file. You can do a find and replace for
all occurrences of case_name to whatever your case name is. For example, 
for cloud_feedback_s12, you would replace all occurrences of case_name
with cloud_feedback_s12 (or whatever you type after run_scm.bash).

3. Test your changes. If you have data, plotgen should automatically plot
it for you. 

Some cases are unique, so you may need to modify the case files for your
current situation. The template files are still a good starting point.
