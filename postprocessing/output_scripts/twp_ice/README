twp_ice_profiles_creator.m is the file responsible for changing GrADS output from CLUBB for TWP_ICE into the netCDF file containing profiles requested for the TWP_ICE SCM intercomparison. It requires header_read.m and read_grads_clubb_endian.m in order to read GrADS data. It uses MATLAB R2008b's built in netCDF functions in order to write out the file.

twp_ice_timeseries_creator.m is the file responsible for changing GrADS output from CLUBB for TWP_ICE into the netCDF containing timeseries file requested for the TWP_ICE SCM intercomparison. It requires header_read.m and read_grads_clubb_endian.m in order to read GrADS data. It uses MATLAB R2008b's built in netCDF functions in order to write out the file.

create_output.bash is a driver for the above two scripts. Assuming TWP_ICE GrADS output is in clubb/output, the script runs the above two MATLAB scripts and creates two output files, profiles.CLUBB_p00.nc which contains the profiles and timeseries.CLUBB_p00.nc which contains the timeseries.
