Introduction:
-------------
The files in this directory create and test netCDF files for submission
to the CGILS (cloud_feedback) CFMIP-GCSS intercomparison.  
The CGILS intercomparison actually involves 6 separate cases (s6, s6_p2k, etc.),
and these scripts output a separate .nc file for each case.

Submissions:
------------
14 Aug 2009: Submitted results created with SVN revision r3995 and updated
nu6 in input/tunable_parameters/tunable_parameters.in to 10.

How to generate and verify data:
--------------------------------
These scripts were overhauled for ticket #300 to make them easier to use.  For detailed information on changes made, see this ticket.

The only files that should need to be modified are create_output.bash and possibly cloud_feedback_timeseries_plot.m.  In create_output.bash, edit the path to the CLUBB output files (e.g. GrADS .ctl and .dat files), and then edit the paths to the desired directories for the netcdf files  and verify PDF plots.  Note that these directories do not need to exist; the script will create them and modify and change permissions to the folders if necessary.

In cloud_feedback_timeseries_plot.m, edit the add paths to point to the utilities.  Currently, if you are working on Scott, these will not need to be modified as a copy resides in /home/meyernr.  If you are working on Condella, a copy can be found in /home/senkbeir.  If you are working on another machine, the files will need to be copied to that computer, or your work will need to be moved to one of these computers.

The current version requires only create_output.bash to be run in order to generate both the netcdf output and the verify PDFs. 
	$ ./create_output.bash

Description of Files:
---------------------
cloud_feedback_output_creator.m: The file is responsible for changing GrADS output
from CLUBB for cloud_feedback into the netCDF file requested in the case 
specification. It requires header_read.m and read_grads_clubb_endian.m in order 
to read GrADS data. It uses MATLAB R2008b's built in netCDF functions in 
order to write out the file.

create_output.bash: The script that runs cloud_feedback_output_creator.m for
all of the cloud_feedback cases (S6, S6_p2k, S11, S11_p2k, S12, and S12_p2k).

cloud_feedback_timeseries_plot.m: This file creates pdfs of the plots for each variable
so the netCDF files can be verified.

Notes:
--------------------
IMPORTANT: Do not leave either of the matlab (.m) scripts open in an editor while trying to run create_output.bash!  The vim edits will fail and the results will simply overwrite each other.

If you wish to only do this for certain cases, simply edit the array at the top on create_output.bash and remove the cases you do not wish to run.

This script can also be generalized for other cases.  Replace the case names in the array at the top of create_output.bash with the case name to be run (e.g. the string before the .ctl or .dat in the GrADS files).  The filenames in the Matlab scripts will need to be changed if you don't want everything to be called cloud_feedback_***.  Otherwise this should be relatively easy to modify to create netcdf output for any case.
