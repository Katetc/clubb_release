Introduction:
-------------
The files in this directory create and test netCDF files for submission
to the CGILS (cloud_feedback) CFMIP-GCSS intercomparison.  
The CGILS intercomparison actually involves 6 separate cases (s6, s6_p2k, etc.),
and these scripts output a separate .nc file for each case.

Submissions:
------------
14 Aug 2009: Submitted results created with SVN revision r3995 and updated
nu6 in input/tunable_parameters/tunable_parameters.in to 10.

How to generate and verify data:
--------------------------------
These scripts were overhauled for ticket #300 to make them easier to use.  For detailed information on changes made, see this ticket.

The only file that should need to be modified is create_output.bash (unless you wish to use these scripts for cases other than cloud_feedback, see notes for more information on this).  In create_output.bash, edit the path to the CLUBB output files (e.g. GrADS .ctl and .dat files), and then edit the paths to the desired directories for the netcdf files and verify PDF plots.  For the file paths, it is necessary to put the lst '/' character in the directory strings, otherwise Matlab will not be able to open the files.  Note that these directories do not need to exist; the script will create them and modify and change permissions to the folders if necessary.

The current version requires only create_output.bash to be run in order to generate both the netcdf output and the verify PDFs. 
	$ ./create_output.bash

Description of Files:
---------------------
cloud_feedback_output_creator.m: The file is responsible for changing GrADS output
from CLUBB for cloud_feedback into the netCDF file requested in the case 
specification. It requires header_read.m and read_grads_clubb_endian.m in order 
to read GrADS data. It uses MATLAB R2008b's built in netCDF functions in 
order to write out the file.

create_output.bash: The script that runs cloud_feedback_output_creator.m for
all of the cloud_feedback cases (S6, S6_p2k, S11, S11_p2k, S12, and S12_p2k).

cloud_feedback_timeseries_plot.m: This file creates pdfs of the plots for each variable
so the netCDF files can be verified.

Notes:
--------------------
IMPORTANT: Do not leave either of the matlab (.m) scripts open in an editor while trying to run create_output.bash!  The vim edits will fail and the results will simply overwrite each other.

If you wish to only do this for certain cases, simply edit the array at the top on create_output.bash and remove the cases you do not wish to run.

This script can also be generalized for other cases.  Replace the case names in the array at the top of create_output.bash with the case name to be
run (e.g. the string before the .ctl or .dat in the GrADS files).  The filenames in the Matlab scripts will need to be changed if you don't want
everything to be called cloud_feedback_***.  Otherwise this should be relatively easy to modify to create netcdf output for any case.

If you desire to only generate netcdf files or create verify pdfs, simply comment out the corresponding line and then run the script as normal.

For merging pdfs, if there are multiple cases and the case names are similar (e.g. cloud_feedback_s6 and cloud_feedback_s6_p2k) put the longer names
first in the array of case names.  If this isn't done, the longer case name plots will be included in the shorter case name plots and the longer
case name plot file will be empty.
