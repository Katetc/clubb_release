cloud_feedback_output_creator.m: The file responsible for changing GrADS output
from CLUBB for cloud_feedback into the netCDF file requested in the case 
specification. It requires header_read.m and read_grads_clubb_endian.m in order 
to read GrADS data. It uses MATLAB R2008b's built in netCDF functions in 
order to write out the file.

netcdf_cloud_feedback_reader.m: The file that reads the netCDF file created 
by cloud_feedback_output_creator.m. It was used to verify the proper 
operation of cloud_feedback_output_creator.m.

create_output.bash: The script that runs cloud_feedback_output_creator.m for
all of the cloud_feedback cases (S6, S6_p2k, S11, S11_p2k, S12, and S12_p2k).
