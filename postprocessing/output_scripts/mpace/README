These utilities are useful when dealing with the MPACE case.  All of 
these scripts are run in MATLAB.

make_mpace_files.m is the original script used to make the required 
formatted text output for the MPACE intercomparison.
make_mpace_files_heights.m is identical except that it includes 
additional output files (height levels) as requested by the MPACE 
primary investigators.  It uses the other scripts in the directory to 
open and read the GrADS files containing the data to be written to the 
text files.
