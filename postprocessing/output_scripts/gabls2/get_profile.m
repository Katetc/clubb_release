% This program was written as an interface to read_grads_hoc_endian.
% It is often used inside a loop of variable names, returning a profile
% for every variable.  It was originally written by Michael Falk and
% later modified by Adam Smith.  All of the original comments are left
% intact below.
%
% The sim variable seems to be set to 1 for little-endian data files and to
% 0 for big-endian data files.

%GET_PROFILE   Accesses stats files, calls read_grads_hoc_endian to get profiles.

%
%   This program takes a variable list from the parent program, and loops through it
%   until we find an entry matching the name of the variable to be observed.  The
%   program then generates and executes a call statement to read_grads_hoc_endian.m,
%   which returns the desired variable profile.  get_profile then passes the profile
%   back to the parent program for observation and manipulation.

%   INPUTS
%   ------
%   les_path  -> File path to the GrADS statistics files for our simulation
%   datfile   -> Name of the simulation's GrADS data file (usually stats_sm.dat)
%   numvars   -> Total number of variables in the GrADS data file
%   list_vars -> Array of all variables contained in the GrADS data file
%   nzmax        -> Total number of altitudes in the GrADS data file
%   t1        -> Initial time to examine in simulation
%   t2        -> Final time to examine in simulation; if t1 and t2 are different,
%                we obtain an averaged profile over the period from t1 to t2.
%   variable  -> The specific variable we wish to examine
%
%   OUTPUTS
%   -------
%   profile -> GrADS profile of the variable we wish to examine
