The Cost_function directory contains MATLAB scripts used to calculate 
the cost function in HOC.

The output_scripts directory contains MATLAB scripts used to create the 
case-specific output files for the GABLS2, mpace_b, and rico 
intercomparisons.  These files were written by Michael Falk.

The profile_comparisons directory contains MATLAB scripts used to 
compare time-averaged profiles between LES and HOC for 18 different 
variable fields.  These files were written by Brian Griffin using some 
functions written by Michael Falk.

The run_comparisons directory contains a MATLAB script which will 
compare two runs of a given case and give you a list of which fields 
differ (which is useful assuming most of the fields are the same).  
There is also a script which reads NetCDF files into MATLAB, which may 
be useful as a model for NetCDF (MexCDF/MexNC)-based programs you may 
write.

The check_budgets_balance directory contains python scripts for
checking stats variables to see if the budgets balance.
