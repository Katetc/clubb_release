! clubb_stats_file is the name of clubb stats file;  This should be the same as 
!   fname_zm  or fname_zm in the statsnl namelist.
! les_stats_file is the name of LES grads data file
! z_i and z_f are levels to look at when tuning. This does not need
!   to be 1 to nz if you wish to optimize for particular altitudes.
!   Note that the first and last z-levels in CLUBB are not prognosed.
! time_nl is the time interval(s) to tune for, in ordered pair form.
